## Introduction

Laravel LogViewer was created by, and is maintained by [Graham Campbell](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell), and provides a LogViewer admin module for [Laravel 4.1+](http://laravel.com). It relies on some of my packages including [Laravel Core](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Core). Feel free to check out the [change log](CHANGELOG.md), [releases](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-LogViewer/releases), [license](LICENSE.md), [api docs](http://docs.grahamjcampbell.co.uk), and [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).


## Installation

[PHP](https://php.net) 5.4+ or [HHVM](http://hhvm.com) 3.2+, and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) are required.

To get the latest version of Laravel LogViewer, simply require `"graham-campbell/logviewer": "~0.2"` in your `composer.json` file. You'll then need to run `composer install` or `composer update` to download it and have the autoloader updated.

You will need to register a few service providers before you attempt to load the Laravel LogViewer service provider. Open up `app/config/app.php` and add the following to the `providers` key.

* `'Lightgear\Asset\AssetServiceProvider'`
* `'GrahamCampbell\Core\CoreServiceProvider'`

Once Laravel LogViewer is installed, you need to register the service provider. Open up `app/config/app.php` and add the following to the `providers` key.

* `'GrahamCampbell\LogViewer\LogViewerServiceProvider'`


## Configuration

Laravel LogViewer supports optional configuration.

To get started, first publish the package config file:

```bash
$ php artisan config:publish graham-campbell/logviewer
```

There are two config options:

##### Filters

This option (`'filters'`) defines the filters to be put in front of the endpoints provided by this package. A common use will be for your own authentication filters. The default value for this setting is `array()`.

##### Per Page

This option (`'per_page'`) defines defines how many log entries are displayed per page. The default value for this setting is `20`.


## Usage

Laravel LogViewer is designed to work with [Bootstrap CMS](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Bootstrap-CMS). In order for it to work in any Laravel application, you must ensure that you have [app/config/platform.php](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Platform/blob/master/app/config/platform.php) and [app/config/views.php](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Platform/blob/master/app/config/views.php) correctly configured, and you know how to use my [Laravel Core](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Core) package as knowledge of the `app:install` and `app:update ` commands is required.

Laravel LogViewer will register four routes. The only one of interest to you is `'logviewer'` (`logviewer.index`) as it will be the main entry point for the use of this package. You can checkout the other three routes in the [source](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-LogViewer/blob/master/src/routes.php) if you must.

The internals of Laravel LogViewer are not documented here, but feel free to check out the [API Documentation](http://docs.grahamjcampbell.co.uk).

You may see an example of implementation in [Bootstrap CMS](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Bootstrap-CMS).
