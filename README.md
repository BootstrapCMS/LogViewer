## What Is Laravel LogViewer?

Laravel LogViewer provides a LogViewer admin module For [Laravel 4.1](http://laravel.com).

* Laravel LogViewer was created by, and is maintained by [Graham Campbell](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell).
* Laravel CloudFlare relies on a few of my packages including [Laravel Core](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Core) and [Laravel Viewer](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Viewer).
* Laravel LogViewer uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-LogViewer) with [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/r/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-LogViewer) to check everything is working.
* Laravel LogViewer uses [Scrutinizer CI](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-LogViewer) and [SensioLabsInsight](https://insight.sensiolabs.com/projects/2649702d-f080-429b-b17c-dacba1c4c15a) to run additional checks.
* Laravel LogViewer uses [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) to load and manage dependencies.
* Laravel LogViewer provides a [change log](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-LogViewer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), [releases](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-LogViewer/releases), and [api docs](http://grahamcampbell.github.io/Laravel-LogViewer).
* Laravel LogViewer is licensed under the Apache License, available [here](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-LogViewer/blob/master/LICENSE.md).


## System Requirements

* PHP 5.4.7+ or HHVM 3.0+ is required.
* You will need [Laravel 4.1](http://laravel.com) because this package is designed for it.
* You will need [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) installed to load the dependencies of Laravel LogViewer.


## Installation

Please check the system requirements before installing Laravel LogViewer.

To get the latest version of Laravel LogViewer, simply require `"graham-campbell/logviewer": "0.1.*@dev"` in your `composer.json` file. You'll then need to run `composer install` or `composer update` to download it and have the autoloader updated.

You will need to register a few service providers before you attempt to load the Laravel LogViewer service provider. Open up `app/config/app.php` and add the following to the `providers` key.

* `'Lightgear\Asset\AssetServiceProvider'`
* `'GrahamCampbell\Core\CoreServiceProvider'`
* `'GrahamCampbell\Viewer\ViewerServiceProvider'`

Once Laravel LogViewer is installed, you need to register the service provider. Open up `app/config/app.php` and add the following to the `providers` key.

* `'GrahamCampbell\LogViewer\LogViewerServiceProvider'`


## Configuration

Laravel LogViewer supports optional configuration.

To get started, first publish the package config file:

    php artisan config:publish graham-campbell/logviewer

There are two config options:

**Filters**

This option (`'filters'`) defines the filters to be put in front of the endpoints provided by this package. A common use will be for your own authentication filters. The default value for this setting is `array()`.

**Per Page**

This option (`'per_page'`) defines defines how many log entries are displayed per page. The default value for this setting is `20`.


## Usage

There is currently no usage documentation besides the [API Documentation](http://grahamcampbell.github.io/Laravel-LogViewer
) for Laravel LogViewer.


## Updating Your Fork

Before submitting a pull request, you should ensure that your fork is up to date.

You may fork Laravel LogViewer:

    git remote add upstream git://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-LogViewer.git

The first command is only necessary the first time. If you have issues merging, you will need to get a merge tool such as [P4Merge](http://perforce.com/product/components/perforce_visual_merge_and_diff_tools).

You can then update the branch:

    git pull --rebase upstream master
    git push --force origin <branch_name>

Once it is set up, run `git mergetool`. Once all conflicts are fixed, run `git rebase --continue`, and `git push --force origin <branch_name>`.


## Pull Requests

Please review these guidelines before submitting any pull requests.

* When submitting bug fixes, check if a maintenance branch exists for an older series, then pull against that older branch if the bug is present in it.
* Before sending a pull request for a new feature, you should first create an issue with [Proposal] in the title.
* Please follow the [PSR-2 Coding Style](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) and [PHP-FIG Naming Conventions](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/bylaws/002-psr-naming-conventions.md).
